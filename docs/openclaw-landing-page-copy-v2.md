# Clawdbot Setup - Landing Page Copy (V2)

## 1. HERO

**Badge:** AI WITH REMY

### Headline
Set up your own Clawdbot for $10/month without buying a Mac Mini or getting hacked

### Subheadline
The complete blueprint to deploy Clawdbot on a VPS, secured and optimized from day one, even if you're not technical.

### Hook
You've seen the Clawdbot demos. You know what it can do. The gap between "that looks incredible" and "I have this running on my machine" feels massive. It doesn't have to be.

## 3. THE PROBLEM (PAS Sales Letter)

### Section Header
Everyone's talking about Clawdbot. You still don't have it running.

### Body Copy

You've seen the demos. Founders on X showing off their AI assistant drafting emails, managing calendars, handling tasks while they sleep.

You want in. But every time you sit down to set it up, you hit a wall.

The "official" setup wants you to buy a Mac Mini. That's $500+ before you've installed anything.

The security side is sketchy. People are getting API keys stolen. Bots going rogue. The creator himself said if you can't run a command line, "this is far too dangerous for you to use safely."

The docs assume you already know what a daemon is and how to configure a firewall. For most people, that's a dead end.

And people who do push through? They're burning $10-20/day on API costs because nobody told them how to configure things properly.

**I built this guide so you can skip all of that.**

A clear, step-by-step system to get Clawdbot running on a $10/month cloud server. Secured and optimized from day one. No Mac Mini. No dev background. One afternoon.

### Guarantee Badge
**7-day money-back guarantee.** Follow the steps. If it doesn't work, you get your money back.

## 4. WHO THIS IS FOR

### Section Header
Is this for you?

### This is for you if:

- You've seen the Clawdbot demos and want it running
- You're comfortable using AI tools like ChatGPT, Claude, and Projects (you don't need to be technical, but you should know the basics)
- You'd rather spend $10/month on a cloud server than $500 on hardware
- You want security handled properly from the start, not figured out after something goes wrong
- You value getting it done in an afternoon over spending weeks troubleshooting

### This is NOT for you if:

- You're not comfortable using basic AI tools like ChatGPT or Claude yet (get familiar with those first, then come back)
- You're already running Linux servers and managing deployments (you probably don't need this)
- You're looking for a hosted, managed solution where someone else runs everything (this is self-hosted, you own the server)
- You're not willing to spend $2-5/day on AI API costs (even optimized, running Clawdbot isn't free)

### THE CORE: Clawdbot VPS Setup Guide

An 8-part walkthrough written for people who have never touched a terminal before. About 2 hours start to finish.

**Server setup and security hardening** - Cloud server running for ~$12/month, locked down with SSH keys, firewall rules, intrusion detection, and auto-updating security patches.

**AI model configuration** - One API key through OpenRouter that gives you access to Claude, GPT-4, Gemini, and more. Built-in spending limits so a stolen key costs you $50, not $5,000.

**Telegram bot setup** - Create your bot, connect it to your server, and set up an allowlist so only you can use it.

**Persistent memory** - Your Clawdbot remembers context across conversations. Local storage, so your data stays on your server.

**Secure dashboard access** - Private encrypted tunnel through Tailscale so you can access your dashboard from anywhere without exposing it to the internet.

**Customization and troubleshooting** - Configure your bot's personality, set up proactive check-ins, and know exactly where to look when things break.

**Delivery:** Instant access. Lifetime updates as OpenClaw evolves.

## 7. FAQ

### Section Header
Frequently asked questions

---

**Q: Is there a money-back guarantee?**

Yes. You have 7 days. If you follow the guide and can't get Clawdbot running, you get a full refund. No hoops.

---

**Q: Is a VPS actually as good as a Mac Mini?**

For most people, better. Always-on without hardware running in your house. Accessible from anywhere. Easier to isolate and rebuild if something gets compromised. $10/month is a fraction of what a Mac Mini costs over time.

---

**Q: Do I need to be technical?**

You don't need to know how to code. But you should be comfortable using AI tools like ChatGPT, Claude, and Projects. The guide is written for tech-curious people, not developers. Every command is explained, and if you get stuck, the guide shows you how to use Claude as your copilot to troubleshoot in real time.

---

**Q: What are the ongoing costs?**

~$12/month for server hosting. $2-5/day for AI model usage depending on how much you use it. Optional $5-10/month for a separate phone number if you want WhatsApp. The Model Optimization Guide helps keep API costs as low as possible.

---

**Q: Can I upgrade from DIY to Done-With-You later?**

Yes. If you buy the DIY kit and decide you want hands-on help, I'll credit your $29 toward the setup call.
