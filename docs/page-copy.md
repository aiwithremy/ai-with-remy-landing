## Letter Section (Email Window)

**Section Label:** [03] // LETTER

**To:** You

**From:** Remy

**Subject:** Why I started this newsletter

### Email Body:

We're living through a special time right now. Thanks to AI, you can do **more as one person with less time, work, and money,** than an entire business could do in the past.

The problem is... AI moves fast. Really fast. New tools every day, constant updates, endless "hype".

You don't have time to live on X, read every OpenAI release, or watch hours of YouTube just to keep up.

You're trusting me to cut through all of it - to test the tools, read the releases, watch the demos, and bring you only what matters.

That means the world to me. I don't take that lightly.

Every Thursday, you'll get one email from me with everything you need to stay up to date and **actually use AI to grow your business**.

**Signature:** - Remy

**Section Label:** [06] // FAQ

**Headline:** Frequently asked questions

### FAQ 1

**Question:** Is this newsletter really free?

**Answer:** Yes, completely free. I share my best workflows without a paywall because I believe solopreneurs deserve real leverage, not locked content. No catch, no upsells hiding behind the signup.

### FAQ 2

**Question:** How often will I receive emails?

**Answer:** Once a week, typically on Thursday mornings. No spam, no daily "tips," just one actionable newsletter you can implement that day. Your inbox will thank you.

### FAQ 3

**Answer:** Not at all. I write for tech-curious non-technical people. If you can use ChatGPT and Notion, you can implement everything I share. No coding required—ever.

### FAQ 4

**Question:** Can I unsubscribe anytime?

**Answer:** Absolutely. One click at the bottom of any email and you're out. No hard feelings, no guilt trips, no "are you sure?" popups. Your inbox, your rules.
