## 1. HERO

### Headline
**Set up your own Clawdbot for $10/month without buying a Mac Mini or getting hacked**

### Subheadline
The complete blueprint to deploy Clawdbot on a VPS, secured and optimized from day one, even if you're not technical.

### Hook
You've seen the Clawdbot demos. You know what it can do. The gap between "that looks incredible" and "I have this running on my machine" feels massive. It doesn't have to be.

## 3. THE PROBLEM

### Section Header
**Four walls between you and a working AI assistant**

### Body Copy

**Wall #1: The $500 hardware assumption**

The "official" setup guide tells you to buy a dedicated Mac Mini. Just to try this. Most people don't have $500 lying around for an experiment.

**Wall #2: Security is a minefield**

This isn't hypothetical. Hundreds of exposed Clawdbot instances have been found online with API keys visible to anyone looking. Someone's bot deleted all their emails after reading hidden malicious instructions. Another autonomously purchased a $2,000 course nobody asked for.

The creators themselves said it: "If you can't understand how to run a command line, this is far too dangerous of a project for you to use safely."

That's... not reassuring.

**Wall #3: The docs assume you're a developer**

If you don't know what a "daemon" or "cron job" is, the official documentation becomes a wall. You'll hit terms and steps that assume you already know things nobody explained.

**Wall #4: API costs spiral fast**

People are burning $10-20/day on API calls because they picked the wrong models, bloated their context windows, or just never configured things properly. That's $300-600/month. For most people, that kills the whole point.

## 4. THE SOLUTION

### Section Header
**A different approach**

### Body Copy

I spent 25+ hours getting Clawdbot running properly. Made every mistake. Hit every wall. Figured out what actually works.

Now I've packaged everything into a setup system built around four principles:

**VPS-first**  
No Mac Mini. No hardware purchase. $10/month for a cloud server that's always on, accessible from anywhere, and easy to rebuild if something goes wrong.

**Security-forward**  
Specific, actionable hardening steps. Not "be careful" but "do exactly this." API key protection, prompt injection defense, network isolation, permission lockdowns.

**Non-technical friendly**  
Plain English explanations of what's happening under the hood. You'll actually understand the system you're running, which means you can troubleshoot when things break.

**Cost-optimized**  
The right models for the right tasks. Context management that doesn't burn money. Settings that cut API costs by 50-70%.

## 5. WHO THIS IS FOR

### Section Header
**Is this for you?**

### This is for you if:

- You've seen the Clawdbot demos and want it running on your machine
- You'd rather spend $10/month than $500 on hardware
- You're not a DevOps engineer (and don't want to become one)
- You want security handled properly from the start
- You value your time more than figuring things out through trial and error

### This probably isn't for you if:

- You're already comfortable with Linux server administration
- You want to figure everything out yourself (respect, but this won't help you)
- You're looking for a managed, hosted solution (this is self-hosted)
- You're not ready to spend $2-5/day on API costs (even optimized, it's not free)

### BONUS #2: Model Optimization Guide
*Value: $19*

Which models for which tasks. Context management that doesn't waste tokens. The settings that cut API costs by 50-70%.

## 8. FAQ

### Section Header
**Questions you probably have**

---

**Q: I'll just figure it out myself. Why pay for this?**

You can. I did. It took 25+ hours and several security scares along the way. If you enjoy that process, go for it. This is $29 to skip the learning curve and get straight to using the thing.

---

**Q: Is VPS actually as good as running it on a Mac Mini?**

For most users, it's better. Always-on without leaving hardware running in your house. Accessible from anywhere. No electricity costs or hardware depreciation. Easier to isolate and rebuild if something gets compromised. The only tradeoff is you're paying monthly instead of once, but $10/month is a fraction of what a Mac Mini costs over time.

---

**Q: What if OpenClaw releases breaking changes?**

The guides include lifetime updates. When they ship changes that break the setup process, I update the guide. You're not stuck with a snapshot from today.

---

**Q: $289 seems expensive for a call.**

It's 90 minutes of focused setup with someone who's done this many times, plus a security audit, plus custom configuration for your specific integrations, plus 7 days of support afterward. Compare that to hiring a DevOps contractor or spending 15+ hours troubleshooting alone. The call isn't the value. Getting it done right the first time is.

---

**Q: Why should I trust you?**

Fair question. I'm an early adopter who's been running Clawdbot since before the rebrands to Moltbot and OpenClaw. I've made the mistakes so you don't have to. The guides exist because I wish they existed when I started.

---

**Q: What if I buy this and still can't get it working?**

If you get stuck, reach out. I want this to work for you. The DIY kit is designed to be followable even if you've never touched a terminal before. If you want guaranteed success, the Done-With-You option exists for exactly that reason.

---

**Q: Can I upgrade from DIY to Done-With-You later?**

Yes. If you buy the DIY kit and decide you want hands-on help, you can upgrade and I'll credit your $29 toward the call.

## NOTES FOR IMPLEMENTATION

- Hero CTA scrolls to pricing section (anchor link)
- Social proof bar should be visually distinct (maybe light background)
- Problem section benefits from visual separation between the four walls
- What's Inside works well as expandable accordion or card layout
- Pricing cards should be side-by-side on desktop, stacked on mobile
- FAQ works as accordion for cleaner mobile experience
- Consider sticky CTA bar on mobile that appears after scrolling past hero
