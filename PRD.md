This Product Requirements Document (PRD) defines the requirements for the **AI with Remy** landing page. The goal is to create a high-converting digital space that pairs modern, high-end minimalism with a "Retro-Technical" soul—inspired by 1990s technical manuals and early digital art, but polished for a premium audience of tech-savvy solopreneurs.

## 1. Visual Identity & Aesthetic Direction

The core aesthetic is **"Sophisticated Digital Nostalgia."** It must feel clean and expansive, punctuated by charming retro elements that pay homage to technology without appearing "hacker-focused" or intimidating.

### Core Visual Principles

* **The "Wait" Layout:** The entire page must be center-aligned within a narrow container, surrounded by generous white space on both sides to ensure a premium, focused feel.
* **The "Spaceship" Balance:** Use a stark white background and modern sans-serif fonts for all primary information to ensure clarity, while using pixelated headers to establish the retro theme.
* **Dithered Imagery & ASCII:** Incorporate high-contrast dithered images or ASCII art (similar to the **RYSA** style) to add texture and personality.
* **Accent Color Strategy:** Use "Blueprint Blue" only as an extremely subtle accent color, applied very sporadically for tiny details (like a single pixel dot or a thin line) to avoid a "technical blueprint" look.
* **No Blueprint Art:** Avoid the complex schematic illustrations found in the "Making Software" site; focus instead on clean, modern cards and text blocks.

### Typography & UI Elements

* **Display Headers:** A pixel-grid font for primary section titles to provide a distinctive retro-tech feel.
* **Body Text:** A high-fidelity, modern sans-serif font for all long-form copy and benefits, prioritizing readability and a premium aesthetic.
* **Buttons:** Simple, sharp-cornered buttons with 1px borders or high-contrast fills (e.g., solid black or white).

## 2. Page Structure & Component Brief

### I. Hero Section (Immediate Conversion)

* **Design:** A centered container featuring the newsletter logo and a bold, pixelated headline.
* **Visuals:** Include a primary ASCII art element (e.g., a stylized robot or technical shape) on the side to balance the text.
* **Components:** * Benefit-driven H1 in a pixel font.
  * Clear, modern subtext defining the "AI for solopreneurs" value proposition.
  * Minimalist email signup bar with a clean "Join" button.

### II. VSL (Context & Trust)

* **Design:** A video player housed in a clean, 1px outlined frame.
* **Vibe:** The player should be simple and modern, avoiding excessive "tech" overlays while maintaining the centered alignment.

### III. Problem / Us vs. Them

* **Concept:** A comparison showing the difference between "AI Slop" and "AI with Remy".
* **Visuals:** Use clean, grid-based cards or a simple list with modern icons to contrast generic newsletters with Remy’s actionable workflows.

### IV. Mini Sales Letter (Personal Connection)

* **Layout:** A narrow, elegant text column.
* **Style:** Use modern sans-serif text with a decorative drop-cap or a monospaced "From the Desk of Remy" header to create a personal feel.

### V. Benefits Cards (Outcome Reinforcement)

* **Layout:** Four horizontal or grid-based cards.
* **Design:** Each card features a small dithered or pixel icon, a bold headline, and 1-2 lines of supporting text.

### VI. Final CTA & FAQ

* **CTA:** A second signup opportunity mirroring the Hero section to capture visitors after they've scrolled.
* **FAQ:** Clean, accordion-style questions (based on the **Wait** template) to address common subscriber concerns.

### VII. Footer

* **Design:** Minimalist layout with a thin divider line.
* **Content:** Copyright, social links, and legal links in small, monospaced text.
