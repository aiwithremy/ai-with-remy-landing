# Clawdbot Setup Offer Brief

## The Hook

**"Skip the $500 Mac Mini. Run Clawdbot on a $10/month VPS—without getting hacked."**

---

## The Problem

Everyone's talking about Clawdbot/OpenClaw. The demos look incredible. But:

1. **The "official" setup requires a Mac Mini** — $500+ just to get started
2. **Security is a minefield** — people are getting prompt-injected, API keys exposed, bots going rogue
3. **The docs assume you're a developer** — if you don't know what a "daemon" is, you're lost
4. **Model costs spiral fast** — people burning $10-20/day because they don't know how to optimize

You shouldn't need to be a DevOps engineer to have an AI assistant that actually *does things*.

## Pricing Psychology

| Tier | Price | Anchor/Justification |
|------|-------|----------------------|
| DIY | $29 | "Less than 3 months of VPS hosting" / "Less than a ChatGPT Plus subscription" |
| DWY | $289 | "Save 10+ hours of frustration" / "Cheaper than the Mac Mini you don't need to buy" |

**Price gap (10x)** creates clear segmentation:
- $29 is impulse-buy territory for anyone serious about AI
- $289 filters for people who value time over money

---

## Key Differentiators

### 1. VPS-First Approach
Most guides assume Mac Mini. This is the only comprehensive VPS setup guide.
- No $500 hardware purchase
- $10/month ongoing (vs. electricity + hardware depreciation)
- Accessible from anywhere
- Easy to nuke and rebuild if compromised

### 2. Security-Forward
After the exposed instances, prompt injection attacks, and scams—security isn't optional.
- Specific, actionable hardening steps
- Not just "be careful" but "do exactly this"

### 3. Non-Technical Friendly
The backend breakdown demystifies what's happening under the hood.
- Mental models for non-developers
- "Why" not just "how"
- Troubleshooting framework

### 4. Cost Optimization
Most users don't realize they're burning money on suboptimal model choices.
- Task-appropriate model selection
- Context window management
- The 80/20 of API cost reduction

## Objection Handling

| Objection | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| "I'll just figure it out myself" | "You can—I did. It took 15+ hours and several security scares. This is $29 to skip that." |
| "Is VPS as good as Mac Mini?" | "For most users, better. Always-on, no hardware to maintain, accessible anywhere, easy to isolate." |
| "What if OpenClaw changes?" | "Lifetime updates included. When they ship breaking changes, I update the guide." |
| "Why should I trust you?" | [Social proof / credentials / early adopter status] |
| "$289 is expensive for a call" | "It's 90 minutes of focused setup + 7 days of support. Compare to hiring a DevOps contractor." |
